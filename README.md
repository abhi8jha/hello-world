# hello-world
starter pack
there is a lady who's sure, All that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets ther she knows, if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for.
OoooOuuOO, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
There's a sign on the wall, but she want's to be sure
because you know sometimes words have two meaning
In the trees by the brook, there's a song bird who sings
And all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Oooooo it makes me wonder.
